Video filter effects for `canvas`
==============================

Just a testing page for personal use really, showing some filter effects for HTML `video` -> `canvas`.

**See demo page [here](http://neilcarpenter.com/demos/canvas/video-filters/)**

Performance gets laggy at large screen sizes on the demo, and the only video format provided is `.webm` so should work in browsers that support it, but might not, and I don't really care as I'm just using this for testing (works fine in Chrome).

The filter effects are taken from [here](http://www.iandevlin.com/blog/2012/06/html5/filtering-a-webcam-using-getusermedia-and-html5-canvas) and [here](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/imagefilters/).

Demo page uses [stat.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/), and the video is from [openfootage.net](http://www.openfootage.net/).
